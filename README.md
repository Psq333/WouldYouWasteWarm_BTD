This system is projected to reduce the waste of warm in every house.

For this project we use:
  - ESP32
  - ESP8266
  - Temperature sensore
  - Distance sensore

Every window and every radiator have a device. This device will be a client and it will send message at the server that will be installed in the house.
The server will send the information at the web ThingSpeak https://thingspeak.com/ it's web site to collect data for IoT device.
The system has an application which allows the user to view the data.
